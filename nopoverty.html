                    Globally, the number of people living in extreme poverty declined from 36 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2015. But the pace of change is decelerating and the COVID-19 crisis risks reversing decades of progress in the fight against poverty. New research published by the UNU World Institute for Development Economics Research warns that the economic fallout from the global pandemic could increase global poverty by as much as half a billion people, or 8% of the total human population. This would be the first time that poverty has increased globally in thirty years, since 1990.

                    More than 700 million people, or 10 per cent of the world population, still live in extreme poverty today, struggling to fulfil the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few. The majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub-Saharan Africa. Worldwide, the poverty rate in rural areas is 17.2 per centâ€”more than three times higher than in urban areas.
                    <br><br> For those who work, having a job does not guarantee a decent living. In fact, 8 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018. One out of five children live in extreme poverty. Ensuring social protection for all children and other vulnerable groups is critical to reduce poverty.
                    <br><br> To eradicate it, we need to know it. Because surveys themselves are so expensive and unaffordable, developing countries have little reliable data of their own, with 39 out of 59 African countries having conducted less than two surveys from 2000 to 2010. 
                    <br><br>Neal Jean and others from Stanford University used a less costly method to help solve this problem. They used the method of robot learning to train Convolutional Neural Network to predict socioeconomic status of a given region from daytime high-definition satellite images, and validating it using recent economic statistics from five African countries, they found that the algorithm could estimate regional wealth and poverty using only available public data. They had this model program predict local nighttime light conditions by analyzing daytime images. In the process, the model learned to take higher resolution image features and summarize them into lower resolution image features. The researchers noted that there is not much differentiation in nighttime lighting in low spending areas, but the study showed that some things that can only be seen on daytime satellite maps, such as roofing materials, and distance from towns have a very direct relationship with spending power. Combined with the results of training with nighttime lighting, they are more capable of capturing the overall economic living conditions of the region in its entirety. 
                    <br><br>In this example, with the right setup and sufficiently accurate satellite images, a properly trained convolutional neural network is able to peek at effective information from limited resources. With the advantages of cost and generality, these results can be useful in helping the international community analyze and combat poverty
